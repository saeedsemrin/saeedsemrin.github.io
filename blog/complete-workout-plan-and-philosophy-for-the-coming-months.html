            <h1>complete workout plan and philosphy for the coming months</h1>
            
            <p>yes another update. don't worry i an executing my plan relatively, kinda. but i am happy to say that i am performing at a high level. we had our first official team minicamp this weekend. one day in the classroom deciding some key pieces of culture, communication and expectations of the team and for ourselves. day 2 was all at the field, mostly running 7's but with some other drills sprinkled in (focusing on defense). this really was litmus test one.</p>
            
            <p>one area that i have not been so great about is eating. ive gotten it into my head that 195 lbs is my ideal playing weight (currently ebbing and flowing between 205 and 210). the main reason im not there is just due to eating decisions, eating out too much, not following the meal plan, etc. but…. it really hasn't affected me on the field. i haven't felt great, but im playing at a high level. that being said, my target weight range is between 193-198, just so that i am lighter on my feet and take some of the load off my body. it's 100% possible, it's really just the kitchen where it matters.</p>
            
            <p>why we are revamping/going over this again. i kinda deviated from the plan, mostly because the 4:30 am wake up calls were pretty shitty but im back on that grind, and the key to that grind is going to bed at a reasonable hour. not too hard but just takes a little discipline and sacrifice. going to print out my entire workout plan / structure below:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>speed code by pjf:</strong> intended to be 6x a week. 3 hard days (focuses on acceleration, max velocity and agility/change of direction) and 3 chill days.
                    <ul>
                        <li>my current assessment is to do 2-3 of the hard days a week in the am, and integrating the chill days into one plan to do when i feel necessary. i only say that because you'll see i have some biomechanics program to reference for rebuilding/recovery.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                
                <li><strong>conor harris</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>i have 3 of his programs, shoulder health, lower limb health and functional bodybuilding. i am only going to start with the lower limb heath, maybe integrating the shoulder health at some point. two at the same time is too much. 3 days with more work. daily drills as well. no gym work really just hold and hip, knee and ankle health things.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                
                <li><strong>david grey achilles program</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>got recommended this by a guy on instagram and it's been fantastic. had achilles tendonitis for god knows how long and this has really mitigated the issues. 3/4 days a week of tendon work.</li>
                        <li>it comes with a foot health program that is every day. that has really been the crux of my biomechanics issues. every day, get those toes moving. has been a true game changer.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                
                <li><strong>goata</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>people have their own opinions on these guys, mostly because they are abrasive absolutists on instagram, but their work has been magical on my body alignment and biomechanics. as a tight, misaligned hip man with a slight bowleg, it's exactly what i need and their program emphasized for ideal movement patterns. ive been bad at being consistent with this but when i do it's fucking magical.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                
                <li><strong>conditioning</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>i have a 3 day a week plan. as you've read above i got alot of shit going on. this will be done after practices (look below for reference). i already took on that volume , a couple tempos never hurt nobody.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                
                <li><strong>agility</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>i have an agility reference packet i use to scale and advance my agility work. im going to do it before practices (again it'll make more sense below) 2 drills before practice. done maximally. and add some frisbee specific moves.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                
                <li><strong>frisbee foundation</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>two times a week of focused intentional game like throwing working on release points and pivoting paired with realistic and logical progressions.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                
                <li><strong>gym stuff (upper body, core, etc.)</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>this is gonna just be chatgpt workouts. alot of calisthenics, alot of athletic core movements, and some rear foot elevated split squats, hang clean and side to side squats. gym taking the backseat here, im already strong enough i need to be better at translating that force by optimizing my biomechanics through workouts specific to that.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>well that was a long one, if you stumble upon this, congrats this is a significant part of my life. and maybe you could learn from my personal approach and take some of it and apply it to yourself. i have a contact page so if you have any questions feel free to email me.</p>
